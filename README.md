# JavaScipt small problems

My study notes and deliberate practice at solving small Javascript problems. When solving the problems, I used a problem solving method called PEDAC that I learned at Launch School. PEDAC stands for:

P - Understanding the Problem
E - Writing out the examples or test cases
D - Think about the data structure to be used
A - Algorithm
C - Code

In these problems, I focused more on a declarative approach of solving problems.
